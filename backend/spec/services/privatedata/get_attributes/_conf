[Summary]
Description = Gets the list of my personal extended attributes. You can store several attributes which are only readable to me. The attributes are key/value pairs with an "app" parameter as namespace. Store data which is only interesting for your application with your application name as a app namespace. If the data is of general interest use "global" as app parameter. The parameter "app" and "key" are optional in the url. So you access all the attributes from yourself or only the attributes from a specific application or the only the value of one specific key. Only authenticated users are allowed to access this method. Authentication is done by sending a Basic HTTP Authorisation header.
