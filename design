common: useful functions
	the open-result is essential here
	In my understanding, if we want to work on the openapi
	DONNOT define the special struct, 
		for example, person, content, comment ..
	if we define it, we miss the sprite of openapi.
	as openapi is already well defined ( the function, the args, the return data )
	we just need to use it, restruct is a duplicate work.
liboasyncworker: the lib get from upstream
	not fully understand it, just use it to 分配 task
lib:	gnome-app-store lib
	play as the proxy or server
	provide data to the client
widgets:
	the widgets I draw, should merge widgets in gnome-shell/st
	the final aim is to port all the widgets in jquery
ui: the most important,  all the user interface were designed here
src:
	stage: as the navigator

The ui plays as html, the src plays as the javascript, or we just need to use javascript

1.	MVC	(which is what?)
	visual: clutter-script
		one script, on object
		donnot want to autosize, as the page should be deside by the drawer.
		not the coder, especially in imagination
	control: signal in the script
		implement in the codes
	m:	what is ?
	
2.	
	css +	 html + 	javascript
	css	clutter-script	javascript/c/python ..
