 * @short_description: A fixed layout container
 *
 * A #StGroup is an Actor which contains multiple child actors positioned
 * relative to the #StGroup position. Other operations such as scaling,
 * rotating and clipping of the group will apply to the child actors.
 *
 * A #StGroup's size is defined by the size and position of its children;
 * it will be the smallest non-negative size that covers the right and bottom
 * edges of all of its children.
 *
 * Setting the size on a Group using #ClutterActor methods like
 * clutter_actor_set_size() will override the natural size of the Group,
 * however this will not affect the size of the children and they may still
 * be painted outside of the allocation of the group. One way to constrain
 * the visible area of a #StGroup to a specified allocation is to
 * explicitly set the size of the #StGroup and then use the
 * #ClutterActor:clip-to-allocation property.
